# Advance-Encryption-Tool
A user-friendly AES-256 file encryption tool with a GUI for secure file selection and saving, utilizing password-based key derivation and base64 encoding.This tool provides a simple and secure way to encrypt and decrypt files using the AES-256 encryption algorithm. It features a GUI-based file selection and saving process for ease of use.

## Features
- **AES-256 Encryption**: Uses a strong encryption algorithm for security.
- **GUI-Based File Selection**: Allows users to select files via a graphical interface.
- **Password-Based Encryption**: Utilizes a key derivation function (PBKDF2) for secure password handling.
- **Base64 Encoding**: Ensures safe storage of encrypted data.
- **Automatic IV and Salt Generation**: Improves security by using unique values for each encryption process.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Required dependencies:
  ```sh
  pip install cryptography
  ```

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/aes-encryption-tool.git
   cd aes-encryption-tool
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
Run the script:
```sh
python main.py
```

### Encrypt a File
1. Choose option `1` in the menu.
2. Enter a password for encryption.
3. Select the file to encrypt.
4. Choose where to save the encrypted file.

### Decrypt a File
1. Choose option `2` in the menu.
2. Enter the correct password.
3. Select the encrypted file.
4. Choose where to save the decrypted file.

## Example Output
```
Welcome to the AES-256 File Encryption Tool!
Choose an option:
1. Encrypt a file
2. Decrypt a file
Enter your choice (1 or 2): 1
Enter a password for encryption: ********
Select the file you want to encrypt.
Select where to save the encrypted file.
Encryption successful! Encrypted file saved as: encrypted.txt
```

## Security Considerations
- Choose strong passwords to enhance encryption security.
- The tool does not store passwords, so remember your password to decrypt files.
- Encrypted files include salt and IV for better security but remain unreadable without the correct password.
